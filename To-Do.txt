1. Why Destroy(...) tiles, wouldn't recyclng them be better.  Seems like it would
   be much better for memory consumption.

2. Particle Effects
    - Dice destruction?

3. Sprite Sheet
    - To make pip animation more interesting?

4. I should get rid of RemovePipsEvent and ShootVictimEvent and instead build an ActivateTileEvent with
   lists.  Same thing I did for RefillEvent.

5. Bugs
